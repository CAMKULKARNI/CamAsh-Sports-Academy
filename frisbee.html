this game was inventedby joel silver,a graduate of lafayette college  in 1968.it is a game played between two 7-membered teams.the objective of the game is to score a point by catching a pass in the endzone his team is attacking.an incomplete pass results in a change of possession.this happens when the defence taps the frisbee/disc in midair and it touches the ground.
backhand is the most popular throw in ultimate frisbee.this is when you curl your arm around the disc and tuck it into your body and then straightening your in a flick releasing the disc in a appropriate direction with a final kick of wrist.
a close second in popularity the forehand is also refered to as the flick two finger and side arm throw.momentum comes from the flck of the wrist.this is done by holding the disc out to the side with your index and middle finger on the under side of the disc and swinging your arm forward and whiping your wrist in a motion similar to the motion of a rat tailing someone with a towel.
other throws will be taught in the coaching camp.
